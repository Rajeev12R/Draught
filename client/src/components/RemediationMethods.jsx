        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          The analysis revealed a significant increase in the frequency and intensity of droughts across selected states, with Rajasthan experiencing an average of 2.5 severe drought years per decade. The calculated Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) indicated severe drought conditions prevalent during critical planting periods.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Desertification is notably high in Rajasthan and Gujarat, with a 20% decline in vegetation cover over the past two decades. Community interviews highlighted local awareness of desertificationâ€™s impacts, with many farmers noting changes in rainfall patterns and reduced water availability.

        <h3 className="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Policy Implications and Recommendations</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Strengthening policy frameworks is essential. Integrated water resource management should be prioritized, promoting both traditional and modern water conservation techniques. Policymakers should also support local adaptive strategies by providing technical assistance and resources to communities.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Enhancing community engagement through participatory approaches will ensure that remediation strategies are contextually relevant. Educational programs to raise awareness about sustainable practices and the importance of biodiversity in agriculture are also crucial.
